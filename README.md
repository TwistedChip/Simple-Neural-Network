# Simple-Neural-Network
Neural Network made using Python and mostly pure Python. Packages were only used when needed such as, random (for preprocessing) and math (for the activation function). This neural network is by no means perfect or optimal and was made specifically for the Iris dataset imported from sklearn. This was made as a part of one of my course's final assignments. A threshold is used to determine if the value of the outputs from the neurons correspond to a 0 or a 1 and can be adjusted accordingly.
